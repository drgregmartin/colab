Consider this a handbook that you can use to understand the end-to-end process of importing, exploring, cleaning, manipulating, summarizing, describing, visualizing and analyzing your data. You can work through the book and replicate all of the examples provided, using datasets that are already built into R. Each section includes a QR code that you can scan on your phone that will take you to a video lesson that complements the text of that chapter. The chapters have been written so that it can also be used as a stand-alone reference to solve specific problems - so you can quickly find solutions to problems that you might encounter while working with your data.\n\n\n\ninstallation\ngetting help online"

    "section": "1.3 Your First R Session",
    "text": "1.3 Your First R Session\nWhen you first open RStudio, you may feel a bit overstimulated. By default, there are four separate panes, most of which have multiple tabs. Don’t worry! While all of these have their uses, as we’ll see over the course of this book, you can safely ignore almost all of it for now. In our first R session, we’ll stick almost entirely to the Console tab (the one with the old-school text welcome message). As you read through this chapter, you should try entering the commands in the grey boxes into your console.\n[insert pic of new RStudio session with IKEA-like arrows pointing out the important features. Caption: in case you’re the sort of person that just can’t wait to know]\n\nmotivate with a simple research question about a data set?\n\n\n1.3.1 Simple calculations\nAt the most basic level, R is just a scientific calculator. You can do all the usual operations.\n\n15 * 5\n\n[1] 75\n\n\nMost (if not all) of your favorite math functions are included, as well.\n\nabs(-12)\n\n[1] 12\n\nsin(pi/2)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Variables and assignment\nAs in any programming language, you can assign values to variables and then use those variables in your calculations.\n\npractice_variable <- 12\npractice_variable + 2\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nIn R, the left arrow is used for assignment. While an equal sign (the norm in most languages) will work, we tend to reserve that symbol for other things. It makes sense, actually: a math equal sign is symmetric (so \\(a=b\\) is the same thing as \\(b=a\\)), while assignment is definitely not.\nAlso notive that calculations auto-print by default, but assignments don’t. In the code chunk above, we got output back after the second line but not the first.\nAs a matter of practice, you should give your variables descriptive names; that is, you should avoid using names like x, temp, or even practice_variable. Eventually, your code will get complicated and you’ll be sharing it with others who will appreciate explicit clues as to what everything means. In general, the best variables names are (1) descriptive, (2) short (3) nouns.\n\n\n1.3.3 Vectors and vector operations\nWhen working with data, we often have many observations of the same variable. Many of R’s code functions are built explicitly to respect this need, starting with variable assignment. For instance, the following code stores 5 temperature readings in a single vector and then takes their average.\n\ntemp <- c(98.2, 97.9, 98.5, 98.2)\nmean(temp)\n\n[1] 98.2\n\n\nThe letter c, which stands for concatenate, lets R know that a vector is being created.\nThere are many, many functions which, like mean() take vectors as arguments and give individual numbers back. A few common ones are sd(), sum(), min(), and max().\n\n\n1.3.4 Vectorized operations\nMost computations in R are vectorized, meaning that they can be applied as easily to vectors as individual values.\n\ntemp_c <- (temp - 32) * 5/9\ntemp_c\n\n[1] 36.77778 36.61111 36.94444 36.77778\n\n\nThis includes vector-wise arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).\n\njunk_numbers <- c(1, 3, 2, 2)\ntemp + junk_numbers\n\n[1]  99.2 100.9 100.5 100.2\n\ntemp * junk_numbers\n\n[1]  98.2 293.7 197.0 196.4\n\n\nIf you’re a math person, you should take particular note of the fact that multiplying vectors is not taking a dot product, cross product, wedge product, or any other fancy thing. Those functions exist if you need them - just Google it!\nMost R functions are vectorized, which means they will operate component-wise in the natural way. For instance, the following code takes the natural logarithm of all the temperatures in our little data set.\n\nlog(temp)\n\n[1] 4.587006 4.583947 4.590057 4.587006\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Optional arguments\nMany R functions give the user the option of specifying additional information to refine the way the inputs are processed. The round() functions is a case in point. By default, it rounds values to the nearest integer.\n\nround(log(temp))\n\n[1] 5 5 5 5\n\nround(log(temp), digits = 3)\n\n[1] 4.587 4.584 4.590 4.587\n\n\nHere we’ve specified that R should round these logarithms to three decimal places by explicitly specifying the digits = 3 argument. While it’s often possible to omit the name of the argument,\n\nround(log(temp), 3)\n\n[1] 4.587 4.584 4.590 4.587\n\n\nyou should be judicious about such a shortcut. Clear code helps minimize dumb errors and makes troubleshooting easier, well worth the investment of a few extra keystrokes.\n\n\n1.3.6 Importing simple data sets\nData can take many forms, from simple .csv or .xlsx spreadsheets to nested lists, website data, or even image files. While\n\nImporting a data set with RStudio’s file browser\n$ notation. Summary functions on columns\nQuantitative and categorical data. Mention data types in R but don’t stress\nPreloaded data sets\n\n5 pages"

    "section": "1.1 Your First R Session",
    "text": "1.1 Your First R Session\nWhen you first open RStudio, you may feel a bit overstimulated. By default, there are three separate panes, most of which have multiple tabs. Don’t worry! While all of these have their uses, as we’ll see, you can safely ignore almost all of it when you’re getting started. In our first R session, we’ll stick almost entirely to the Console pane (the one with the old-school text welcome message). All the grey boxes in this chapter show code from the console, together with the resulting output. Obviously, you should be coding along and trying new thigns out as you read!\n\n\n\nRStudio’s default startup screen\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Simple calculations\nAt the most basic level, R is just a scientific calculator. You can do all the usual arithmetic operations, either one at a time or all at once.\n\n(3 * 2 + 1) ^ 2\n\n[1] 49\n\n\nAs you can see, R follows standard order of operations. It also includes the full variety of standard mathematical functions, like absolute value and sine, as well as values for important constants like \\(\\pi\\).\n\nabs(-12)\n\n[1] 12\n\nsin(pi/2)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nDon’t worry - we’re done with trig for the rest of this book.\n\n\n1.1.2 Variables and assignment\nAs in any programming language, you can assign values to variables and then use those variables in your calculations. These variables don’t have to be single letters; in fact, as a general rule you should avoid such short names.\n\npractice_variable <- 12\npractice_variable + 2\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nIn R, the left arrow is used for assignment. While an equal sign (the norm in most languages) will work in R, it’s better to reserve that symbol for other things. This makes sense for a number of reasons, including this one: the mathematical equal sign is symmetric (so a=b is the same thing as b=a), while assignment is directional.\nNotice that in the above code chunk, the calculation auto-printed by default, but the assignment didn’t. We got output back after the second line but not the first. Both of these are typical R behavior.\nAs a matter of practice, you should give your variables descriptive names even when it adds a few keystrokes to your workflow. Eventually, your code will get complicated and you’ll be sharing it with others who will appreciate explicit clues as to what everything means. In general, the best variables names are nouns (that are both descriptive and brief.\n\n\n1.1.3 Vectors and functions of vectors\nWhen working with data, we usually have many observations of each variable. Most of R’s core functions are built explicitly to respect this need, starting with variable assignment. For instance, the following code stores five temperature readings in a single vector and then takes their average.\n\ntemp <- c(98.2, 97.9, 98.5, 98.2, 98.4)\nmean(temp)\n\n[1] 98.24\n\n\nA vector in R is just an ordered sequence of numbers (or other type of data, as we’ll discuss in the next chapter). The letter c, which stands for concatenate, lets R know that a vector is being created.\nThere are many, many functions which, like mean(), take vectors as arguments and give individual numbers back. A few other common ones are sd(), sum(), min(), max(), and length(). Explore to find more!\nOther functions return a vector instead. For instance, you can probably guess what sort(temp) will return. But can you figure out what diff() is doing in the following chunk?\n\ndiff(temp)\n\n[1] -0.3  0.6 -0.3  0.2\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Vectorized operations\nMost computations in R are vectorized, meaning that they can be applied as easily to vectors as individual values. For instance, the following code converts every value in the temps vector from Fahrenheit to Centigrade, then prints the result.\n\ntemp_c <- (temp - 32) * 5/9\ntemp_c\n\n[1] 36.77778 36.61111 36.94444 36.77778 36.88889\n\n\nAddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of vectors is handled component-wise, meaning that R always looks at corresponding elements of the vectors in question.\n\nambient_temp <- c(68.2, 69.3, 67.3, 70.0, 68.3)\ntemp - ambient_temp\n\n[1] 30.0 28.6 31.2 28.2 30.1\n\n\nIf you’re a math person, you should take particular note of the fact that multiplication works this way as well, regardless of what you were taught in linear algebra class.\n\ntemp * c(2, 4, 3, 10, 1)\n\n[1] 196.4 391.6 295.5 982.0  98.4\n\n\nMost built-in R functions are also vectorized, meaning they will operate component-wise in the natural way. For instance, the following code takes the natural logarithm of all the temperatures in our little data set.\n\nlog(temp)\n\n[1] 4.587006 4.583947 4.590057 4.587006 4.589041\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Optional arguments\nMany R functions give the user the option of specifying additional information to refine the way the inputs are processed. The log() functions is a case in point. By default, it compute the natural logarithm, that is, the logarithm with base \\(e\\). We can change this by specifying the base argument.\n\nlog(temp, base = 10)\n\n[1] 1.992111 1.990783 1.993436 1.992111 1.992995\n\n\nWhile R will often allow you to omit the name of the argument, as in the following chunk, you should be judicious in your use of that shortcut.\n\nlog(temp, 10)\n\n[1] 1.992111 1.990783 1.993436 1.992111 1.992995\n\n\nClear code helps minimize errors and makes troubleshooting easier - well worth the investment of a few extra keystrokes.\n\n\n1.1.6 The Environment and History tabs\nFor the first time, let’s look at a pane other than the console. In the upper-right quadrant of your RStudio window, you have two helpful tabs. The first of these, Environment, shows all the user-defined objects that R currently has stored in it’s memory. Currently there are four vectors, ambient_temp, practice_variable, temp, and temp_c. All are numeric vectors (we’ll learn about other types of vectors shortly) and all except practice_variable have length 5. Since the length of practice_variable is one, RStudio just displays its value, not its structure, in the Environment pane.\nNext to this is the History tab, which shows commands that have been executed recently. If you want to re-run one of these commands, you can double-click to send it to the console, where it can be executed as usual.\n\n\n1.1.7 Importing spreadsheets\nWhile reading data into R (or any other system) can get complicated, RStudio makes it easy to import the most common sort of set: the spreadsheet. In the lower-right pane, you’ll find a tab labelled Files, which you can use to browse around your machine until you find the spreadsheet you need.\n(insert image with arrows)\nNotice the breadcrumbs at the top of the Files pane describing your current location. Clicking on one of these will move you back toward your root, while clicking folders in the browser itself will move you away from it. Once you’ve found the file you want, select it and then click Import Dataset from the little menu that appears.\n[image showing import of temperatures.csv]\nA warning to those of you that might be more experienced coders: navigating around in Files tab doesn’t change R’s working directory, as you can check with getwd(). While it’s possible to change this with setwd(), that’s usually not best practice. More about this in chapter (insert ref).\nYou’ll now get a popup showing, among other things, a preview of the spreadsheet and a recommended code snippet to import it. For most day-to-day purposes, it’s totally fine to ignore this window entirely and just click the Import button, which will close the popup and execute the snippet. For more details about how to customize all of this, see chapter (insert ref).\nThe spreadsheet is now saved in R’s working memory, as you can see by checking the Environment tab. RStudio will also automatically open up a fuller preview of the set in a new pane in the upper-left. You can scan around, search, and sort by column values here, if you like.\nIf you look back to your console, you’ll see the code that RStudio has used to make all this happen. We’ll put off talking about library() until in the next chapter and read_csv() much later (insert ref), but View() is worth noticing right away. This is the command that actually caused R to display the data set in that new pane. You’ll find yourself using this command occassionally throughout your data science career.\nThis view is intended as a convenience, not as a real working tool, meaning that R is fundamentally different in its approach than spreadsheet software like Excel. Any real data reorganization or manipulation will take place via our code.\n\n\n1.1.8 Working with data sets\nFundamentally, R views a data frame like temperatures as a collection of columns, each one of which is a vector. To refer to one of these vectors, use the format set$variable, like so:\n\ntemperatures$ambient_temp\n\n[1] 68.2 69.3 67.3 70.0\n\n\nYou can do all the usual things to such a vector, like finding its median.\n\nmedian(temperatures$ambient_temp)\n\n[1] 68.75\n\n\nAdd a new or modify a column with the assignment operator:\n\ntemperatures$difference <- temperatures$temp - temperatures$ambient_temp\ntemperatures\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n   temp ambient_temp difference\n  <dbl>        <dbl>      <dbl>\n1  98.2         68.2       30  \n2  97.9         69.3       28.6\n3  98.5         67.3       31.2\n4  98.2         70         28.2\n\n\nIn chapter (ref) we’ll learn a more general and flexible (but also more verbose) way to add or change columns in a data frame using the mutate() command.\nFinally, there are many functions in R that accept data frames as arguments. For instance, nrow(temperatures) and ncol(temperatures) return the length and width, respectively, of the data frame, while colnames(temperatures) returns, well, the column names. Finally, summary() will provide a six-number summary of each quantitative variable in the set.\n\nsummary(temperatures)\n\n      temp        ambient_temp     difference  \n Min.   :97.90   Min.   :67.30   Min.   :28.2  \n 1st Qu.:98.12   1st Qu.:67.97   1st Qu.:28.5  \n Median :98.20   Median :68.75   Median :29.3  \n Mean   :98.20   Mean   :68.70   Mean   :29.5  \n 3rd Qu.:98.28   3rd Qu.:69.47   3rd Qu.:30.3  \n Max.   :98.50   Max.   :70.00   Max.   :31.2  \n\n\n\n\n1.1.9 Built-in data sets\nR comes with quite a few data sets pre-loaded for you to practice with. For instance, the faithful set includes 272 observations of eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Wyoming, USA. Take a look at the set with View(faithful) and learn a little more about it with ?faithful.\nYou can do all the same things with faithful as you can with the imported data set temperatures. For instance, faitful$eruptions is a vector of length 272 and mean(faithful$eruptions) gives its numerical average (about 3.5 minutes). You can also begin to explore relationships between variables, for instance by computing the correlation between eruption length and time between eruptions.\n\ncor(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting)\n\n[1] 0.9008112\n\n\nYou can see a complete listing of R’s built-in data sets with data()."

RStudio will also automatically open up a fuller preview of the set in a new pane in the upper-left. You can scan around, search, and sort by column values here, if you like.\nIf you look back to your console, you’ll see the code that RStudio has used to make all this happen. We’ll put off talking about library() until in the next chapter and read_csv() much later (insert ref), but View() is worth noticing right away. This is the command that actually caused R to display the data set in that new pane. You’ll find yourself using this command occassionally throughout your data science career.\nThis view is intended as a convenience, not as a real working tool, meaning that R is fundamentally different in its approach than spreadsheet software like Excel. Any real data reorganization or manipulation will take place via our code.\n\n\n1.1.8 Working with data sets\nFundamentally, R views a data frame like temperatures as a collection of columns, each one of which is a vector. To refer to one of these vectors, use the format set$variable, like so:\n\ntemperatures$ambient_temp\n\n[1] 68.2 69.3 67.3 70.0\n\n\nYou can do all the usual things to such a vector, like finding its median.\n\nmedian(temperatures$ambient_temp)\n\n[1] 68.75\n\n\nAdd a new or modify a column with the assignment operator:\n\ntemperatures$difference <- temperatures$temp - temperatures$ambient_temp\ntemperatures\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n   temp ambient_temp difference\n  <dbl>        <dbl>      <dbl>\n1  98.2         68.2       30  \n2  97.9         69.3       28.6\n3  98.5         67.3       31.2\n4  98.2         70         28.2\n\n\nIn chapter (ref) we’ll learn a more general and flexible (but also more verbose) way to add or change columns in a data frame using the mutate() command.\nFinally, there are many functions in R that accept data frames as arguments. For instance, nrow(temperatures) and ncol(temperatures) return the length and width, respectively, of the data frame, while colnames(temperatures) returns, well, the column names. Finally, summary() will provide a six-number summary of each quantitative variable in the set.\n\nsummary(temperatures)\n\n      temp        ambient_temp     difference  \n Min.   :97.90   Min.   :67.30   Min.   :28.2  \n 1st Qu.:98.12   1st Qu.:67.97   1st Qu.:28.5  \n Median :98.20   Median :68.75   Median :29.3  \n Mean   :98.20   Mean   :68.70   Mean   :29.5  \n 3rd Qu.:98.28   3rd Qu.:69.47   3rd Qu.:30.3  \n Max.   :98.50   Max.   :70.00   Max.   :31.2  \n\n\n\n\n1.1.9 Built-in data sets\nR comes with quite a few data sets pre-loaded for you to practice with. For instance, the faithful set includes 272 observations of eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Wyoming, USA. Take a look at the set with View(faithful) and learn a little more about it with ?faithful.\nYou can do all the same things with faithful as you can with the imported data set temperatures. For instance, faitful$eruptions is a vector of length 272 and mean(faithful$eruptions) gives its numerical average (about 3.5 minutes). You can also begin to explore relationships between variables, for instance by computing the correlation between eruption length and time between eruptions.\n\ncor(faithful$eruptions, faithful$waiting)\n\n[1] 0.9008112\n\n\nYou can see a complete listing of R’s built-in data sets with data()."

While an equal sign (the norm in most languages) will work in R, it’s better to reserve that symbol for other things. This makes sense for a number of reasons, including this one: the mathematical equal sign is symmetric (so a=b is the same thing as b=a), while assignment is directional.\nNotice that in the above code chunk, the calculation auto-printed by default, but the assignment didn’t. We got output back after the second line but not the first. Both of these are typical R behavior.\nAs a matter of practice, you should give your variables descriptive names even when it adds a few keystrokes to your workflow. Eventually, your code will get complicated and you’ll be sharing it with others who will appreciate explicit clues as to what everything means. In general, the best variables names are nouns that are both descriptive and brief."

A few other common ones are sd(), sum(), min(), max(), and length(). Explore to find more!\nOther functions return a vector instead.

The packages tab in the lower-right pane of RStudio shows just a small selection of those available.\nOver time, some packages have become so widely-adopted as to be almost core to R itself. Chief among these are the so-called tidyverse family of packages, which are maintained by Posit, the company that makes RStudio itself. The tidyverse consists of eight core packages, nearly all of which we’ll make use of in this book and which we wholeheartedly recommend for your day-to-day data analysis practice.

Here, glimpse() is telling us the data type of each of the vectors making up the mpg set, <chr> for character (strings of letters and other symbols), <dbl> for decimal numbers (technically double-precision floating-point decimal), and <int> for integer. While there are many different data types in R, including date-times (<dttm>) and factors (<fct>), 95% of the time it’s fine to just think of your vectors either as numeric (doubles, integers and the like) or categorical (character, factor, and the like). Unlike other programming languages, R tends to be forgiving about the subtle differences within those larger classifications. See chapter (ref needed) for help with the other 5% of cases.\nThis is illustrated by the simplest plotting function in the tidyverse family, qplot(), short for quick plot, which automatically decides whether to produce a bar chart (categorical data) or histogram (quantitative data).\n\nqplot(mpg$trans)\n\n\n\nqplot(mpg$cty)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
